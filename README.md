# Tesla Clone

A clone of Tesla's website showcasing various car models and solar panels, built with React and styled-components.

## Description

This project replicates the layout and functionality of Tesla's official website. It displays information about different Tesla car models (Model S, Model Y, Model 3, Model X) as well as Tesla's solar panel offering. The app allows users to interact with various sections, learn more about the products, and place an order.

## Features

- Responsive layout with styled-components for custom styling.
- Multiple sections showcasing car models and solar panels.
- Interactive buttons for ordering or viewing existing inventory.
- Dynamic rendering of car models using Redux.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the app.
- **styled-components**: For writing component-level styles.
- **React Router (planned)**: For handling navigation between pages.
- **Redux**: To manage the state of car models dynamically.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tesla-clone.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd tesla-clone

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
   
4. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
This will start the app at http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can view the Tesla models and solar panel sections. Clicking on the buttons will trigger their respective actions. This project will be further enhanced with additional features in the coming days.

## Future Enhancements

- Add React Router for better navigation between different sections.
- Implement a fully-featured order system.
- Integrate with a backend for fetching live data (e.g., car prices, availability).
